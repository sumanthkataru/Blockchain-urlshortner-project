This project is a URL shortener implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses React for the front-end interface and Solidity for the smart contract logic.

Features
Shorten URLs: Users can input a long URL and receive a shortened version.
Redirection: Shortened URLs redirect users to the original long URL.
Blockchain-based: The URL mappings are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
Decentralized: There's no central authority controlling the URL shortening service. It operates autonomously on the blockchain.
